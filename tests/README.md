# Testing UserRepositoryImpl

## Prerequisites
- PHPUnit 9.5 or higher
- Composer dependencies installed

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Test Coverage
This test suite covers:

- Handling cases where no user is found
- Verifying correct user data mapping

## Notes
- Tests use mock objects to simulate database interactions
- Async database methods are mocked to provide predictable test scenarios
